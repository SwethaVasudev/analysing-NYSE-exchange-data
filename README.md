# analysing-NYSE-exchange-data
In this project, I will go through the process of calculating summary statistics, drawing any inference from the statistics, calculating business metrics, and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies. The goal is to perform an analysis and also create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways.
I have included a clean data set for this project. Although in real-life scenarios, data sets often need to be cleaned and processed before analysis can proceed. This project allows to see what a clean data set should look like.
Background:
I used the Fundamentals.csv and Securities.csv files provided by Kaggle. The Fundamentals file provides the fundamental financial data gathered from SEC 10K annual filings from 448 companies listed on the S&P 500 index. The Securities file provided the industry or sector information the companies are categorized under on the S&P 500 index.
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate my skills:
1. interpret the measures of central tendency and spread (mean, median, standard deviation, range).
2. use a combination of Excel or Google Sheets functions (e.g., IF statements, INDEX, and MATCH, calculating descriptive statistics with the IF statement, dropdowns, data validation, VLOOKUP).
3. analyze and forecast financial business metrics using Excel or Google Sheets.
4. create visualizations of a business metric and use Excel or Google Sheets to create a financial forecast model.

The following information is included in the Projectdata NYSE file:
1. Ticker symbol: Stock symbol
2.Years: Number of years for which data is provided
3. Period ending
4. Total revenue
5. Cost of goods sold
6. Sales, General, and Administrative expenses
7. Research and Development expenses
8. Other Operating expense items
9. Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Sector: The industry sector the company is categorized under (e.g., American Airlines with the ticker symbol AAL is categorized under Industrials.)
10. GICS Sub Industry: Sub-industry sector the company is categorized under (e.g., AAL is further categorized under the sub-category of the "Airlines" industry.)

Planning ahead
